# Budgety (description)

Welcome to the Budget app! Working on this project, I have gone through all the advanced JS content about objects, functions arrays and DOM manipulation. The main point of this App is that it allows the end user to add incomes and expenses for the certain month, and this App calculates the amount of money they have made and spent as well as the total percentages.
